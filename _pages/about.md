**Career Objectives**

My name is Masud Pervez, an experienced Data Scientist with over 7 years of expertise. I currently work in fraud detection at a bank, where I leverage advanced machine learning models to identify fraudulent activities. My prior work includes developing models for customer attrition, lifetime value prediction, churn analysis, and recommendation systems.

I am deeply interested in Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I am eager to continue learning and developing in these fields. Additionally, forecasting and statistical analysis are key areas of my expertise, supported by a strong foundation in statistics.

I have extensive experience working with large datasets, from data cleaning and processing to mining and extracting insights. Throughout my career, I have built and fine-tuned machine learning models using techniques such as regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost. I am highly proficient in Python and its libraries for machine learning and data visualization, including Pandas, PyTorch, and Matplotlib. I have also worked on projects focused on building AI systems for practical applications.
